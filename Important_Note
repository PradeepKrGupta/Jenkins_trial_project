If You Want to “Stop” the Website
Here are your real options again:

✅ Option 1: Delete or Rename Files from IIS Folder
Manually go to:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\inetpub\wwwroot
And either:

Delete your index.html or other files

Or rename them (e.g., index_old.html)

Then your site will be “stopped” — it won’t show in the browser.

✅ Option 2: Stop IIS Web Server (temporarily)
Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

cmd
iisreset /stop

To restart it:
iisreset /start
